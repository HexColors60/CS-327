v0.1 - Started generating this dungeon by filling the 80x21 grid with rock.
--------
v0.2 - Using an array of integer values (x,y) dimensions for rooms, and have
       a function that pseudorandomly selects one to attempt to place inside
       the dungeon within the bounds of (1, 78-x) & (1, 19-y).
--------
v0.3 - Created a function to show my progress called print_screen() basically
       every call to it clears the screen and generates the dungeon.
--------
v0.4 - Next project will include figuring out how to eliminate the sleep(1) to
       avoid duplicate rooms.
--------
v0.5 - Ran into a few small problems which created a large problem. First off,
       I created an array of rooms based on ascending x coordinates (in the
       event of a tie, ascending y coordinates). My thought behind this was
       that I would be able to connect them via rooms 1-(n-1) up until n rooms
       being generated. The problem is displayed here:

           r - room; R = rock; t = tunnel
       	   [    rr   rr    	     	]
	   [    rr   rr			]
	   [    rr   t			]
	   [    t  rrrr rr		]
	   [    tttrrrrtrr		]
	   [		rr		]

       as displayed, I would have to go from room 3 - 4 through room 3, so I
       will have to draw the tunnel if and only if it doesn't coincide with
       another room. I feel like I'm making things more complicated than they
       really are, but we'll see.
--------
v0.6 - fixed the room detection and corridor placement by using functions:
       path_up, path_right, path_down. Also finished the program for what the
       requirements are as of now.
--------
v0.7 - Added two functions into the main to allow the user to load and save a
       specified file. More about them can be read about in the readme.txt. I
       also added the check for whether the user inputs --save or --load first
       and made it universal to always load before it saves.
--------
v0.8 - Split the program into separate files according to what they do. Also I
       managed to place the player character on a random location inside a room
       and have a distance map to every square, with the condolences for tunnels.
       Something weird seems to be happening with pathing sometimes where it
       alternates letters side by side.
--------
v0.9 - Implemented monsters and player characters as well as movement based on a
       priority queue. Have the monster movement still to work on, didn't have
       time to get as much of this done as I wished I did.
